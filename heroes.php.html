A brash and strongwilled woman in her mid-20s. She is the captain of the Mórríghan, a ship funded by
the elusive Patron she and the professor often refer to. She and Professor Perry Wilder have known
each other for years, and together instituted the quick-switch routine that "borrowed" the Mórríghan
from its previous developer. Dez Black is trim and short, only about 5'4", and she likes to slip into men's
clothes to confuse her prey-both enemies and consorts. She is a tactician and a brawler, despite her
small size, and many people feel the inexplicable call to follow or assist her. She is willing to use her
charm or her favorite Aethercoil gun, Firefly, to get whatever she wants. Generally she's good hearted-for a fee. She is an opportunist and an adventurer at heart.</p>

	<div style="font-weight:bold;">Professor Perry Wilder, PhDSPMSPMM (PhD in Sciences Political, Medical, Social, Physical,
Mathematical, and Mysterious):</div>
<p>
The Professor, as he is fondly referred to by his peers, is a brilliant mathematician and scientist. His rivals
include Tesla, Edison, and other contemporaries. He is fluent in twelve languages, eleven of them dead.
His astute observations and design capabilities have carried the crew through many tight and puzzling
situations-but he is adverse to physical violence and easily swayed by an attractive woman. The
Professor is generally well dressed and keeps himself well-kempt. He lacks telling gray hair or wrinkles to
show that he is really in his late 30s. He considers himself something of a lady's man, but has a tendency
toward poor timing and thus finds himself the laughing stock of many women. He and the captain are
close friends. They met at a convening of great scientific minds-both of them were attempting to steal
   the same telescope, for different reasons.</p>

	<img src="images/KitGearhart_thumb.jpg" height="150px" class="floatLeft"><div style="font-weight:bold;">Kit Gearhart:</div>
<p>
The mechanic of the crew, Kit is an androgynous 14ish year-old kid with a mechanical genius mind.
Kit is wiry and somewhat boyish looking, with a higher pitched voice and a tendency to wear baggy
work clothes and concealing hats. The only person on the crew-or living, as far as Kit is aware-who
knows whether Kit is male or female is the captain. Generally crewmembers refer to Kit as "he," but
try to avoid assigning a gender. Kit can fix or reconfigure virtually anything, and is highly intelligent for
a teenager, but lacks some level of education and has a strangely patchy vocabulary. Kit is capable of
rebuilding virtually anything, but lacks the technical training to design something from scratch and build
it from the ground up. Kit has been traveling with the captain for about two years.</p>

	<img src="images/PeterRavenwood_thumb.jpg" height="150px" class="floatRight">
	<div style="font-weight:bold;">Peter Ravenwood:</div>
<p>
Peter is the brute of the crew, the gunner, the thug if necessary. He is half Sioux Indian, six feet tall, and
muscular. He is very quiet about his past-or much of anything, really-but he is quick to defend the
captain. He tends to get into many brawls, partly because of his quick temper and partly because in the
Americas, "Injuns" are still widely disliked in this time. He has been traveling with the crew for about
two years, after the last gunsman was killed in a raid.</p>

	<img src="images/Cookie_thumb.jpg" height="100px" class="floatLeft">
	<div style="font-weight:bold;">Victoria Elizabeth Maria Catherine Ethridge:</div>
<p>
"Cookie" for short. Cookie operates as the cook, field surgeon, and general comedic relief for the rest of
the crew. She is a jack of all trades and certainly master of none. She has a tendency to include strange
ingredients in meals, and also claims to be against violence-although she uses it liberally enough when
it suits her. She believes she is an extremely attractive and charming woman, but is really about average,
roughly 5'2" and slightly dumpling-shaped, as the captain occasionally describes her-out of earshot, of
course. The Professor claims interest in her, but she shuns him. She has only been with the crew for a
year.</p>

	<img src="images/Navigator_thumb.jpg" height="100px" class="floatRight">
	<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Navigator:</div>
<p>
He has a name, but the captain never bothered to discover what it was. The Professor interviewed him
and recommended his skills, but Dez is constantly frustrated by her perception of his incompetence and
throws him overboard-usually into the ocean. He always finds a way back on board, and one might
argue that his piloting skills are exceptional with the maneuverable Mórríghan, but his past has yet to be
revealed. As of Episode 1, he has been with the crew for six months-although the captain believes (or
claims to believe) it's a new navigator each time, such is her lack of concern for him.</p>
