      <li><h3>The Story</h3></li>
      <li>As Episode One begins, the crew has recently finished a rather low-paying escapade smuggling fruit from Caribbean islands. They are on their return from that trip. </li><li>
The crew has recently returned from a low-paying escapade smuggling fruit from the Caribbean Islands. On their way back from that trip they were ambushed by the Persephone crew. While licking their wounds in New Orleans, the Captain was kidnapped and offered a well-paying recovery job. As Episode 3 begins, the crew is insistent on attending a Mardi Gras celebration, despite the Captain's misgivings.

<li><h3>Background Info</h3></li>
<li>
The F.M.A.S. Mórríghan, crewed by Captain Decidia "Dez" Black, Professor Perry Wilder, and their latest assembly of misfits and vagabonds, has been identified as a menace by Her Majesty's Military in Britain, as well as being marked for careful watch by U.S. authorities. It is not, as Captain Dez assures anyone who will listen, that they are villains themselves. It is merely that their good deeds tend to have a price, and some are not willing to pay that price.
They are adventurers and opportunists. The Captain considers the crew family-that is, she keeps a close eye on them at all times to watch for signs of treachery or insanity. The Morrighan's flights and excursions after rare and wonderful artifacts and wealth are kept funded by their mysterious Patron-an individual known to be a gambler, who has connections to a wealthy Aunt Vickie in England.
